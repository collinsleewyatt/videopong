VideoPong Honors Project
Collins Wyatt, Fall 2021.

This is a two-player game of pong using WebAssembly.

src/ contains all of the source for the browser implementation.
src/GameManagement - a bunch of general classes, some abstract, that are used for rolling back and input collection.
src/PongGame - specific to the pong game itself (note: protocol.ts is unused)
src/index.ts - the main js file, which calls src/PongGame/PongGame.ts - the main file for the pong game

first time: run npm install.

npx webpack build - build the code and it will send it into dist/.
npm run dev - development server.
node host.js to run on port 8080.
